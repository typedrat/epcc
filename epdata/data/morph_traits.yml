    This trait is generally only found on uplift biomorphs, but might be included on any unusual high-end or custom biomorphs. A much more aggressive version of the genetic rights management used in rusters and other morphs that require maintenance through GSPs (see Planned Obsolescence, p. 165, Sunward), the genehacking used in creating this morph is atypical and includes many sections of suppressed effects and potential problems that make it difficult for anyone not familiar with the initial design to modify the morph. 
    
    Unless "unlocked" by the designer through further genehacking, this morph is sterile, and will reject any biomods not listed as standard for the morph. Worse, due to the extensive and limiting manipulation of the morph's DNA, it is much more prone to cancers and longevity issues than other morphs and has an average life expectancy of only 30-40 years. At the gamemaster's discretion, Medicine Tests to modify or even heal this morph may suffer modifiers ranging from âˆ’10 to âˆ’30.

    It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds with different biochemistries are now being trans- formed into pods by transhumance geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod. Drug treatments beneficial to transhumans may not function at all, for example, while something that transhumans regularly eat or handle may in fact be toxic to the pod and trigger an anaphylactic response. The gamemaster decides when this factor will play a role, based on the pod biochemistry's similarity to that of transhumans and numerous other factors. Certain augmentations may simply not be available, having not yet been invented for the alien physiology in question. 
    
     While efforts have been made to provide these pods with their equivalent of basic biomods, the full protec- tions offered by those enhancements may simply not be available. This means that the pod may or may not be vulnerable to such things as disease, aging, lack of sleep, long-term exposure to microgravity, shock from injuries, allergies, or other biological problems that transhumanity has attempted to eradicate. Likewise, the pod might not be able to heal quickly or regen- erate limbs. It is also possible that the pod may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive. 
    
     Morphs with alien biochemistry count as exotic and inflict -30 modifiers to Alienation and Integrity Tests (p. 272, EP). 
     This trait is only available to pods created from alien life.

    For biomorphs, this radical alteration enables the subject's metabolism to live off solar energy, using medichines to repair radiation damage. This same metabolism also generates powerful electro- magnetic fields that protect the character from the intense temperatures and radiation in the coronal environment and even enable the char- acter to sail the solar winds. Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also have medicines.
     For synthmorphs, this adaptation restructures the morph's composition with heat-resistant materials capable of surviving superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. The shell is also equipped with refractive metama- terials and a perfectly mirrored surface, giving it an albedo of nearly one. The reflective surface protects the wearer from well over 99% of the radiant energy that falls upon it, but a powerful cooling system and extensive radiation shielding are required for the minuscule percentage of energy that slips through. Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines. This adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph's Free Fall skill tests in the presence of strong elec- tromagnetic fields. It also provides 10 points of Energy armor against heat and electromagnetic-based attacks (such as lasers, microwaves, and plasma weapons, but not explosions).

    The morph's metabolism runs hot, requiring the character to eat two to three times as much food as a normal character with similar body mass. Food tends to be plentiful and cheap in most transhuman settlements, but this trait can pose a problem in remote areas or when visiting settlements with limited resources. The character must plan ahead and pack enough food on expeditions. If the character is eating off their rep, they must expend two trivial favors each day for the additional food they require. If the character is unable to obtain enough food, they lose SOM at the rate of one point per day until they resume their usual caloric intake.

    This morph has been designed to operate only in high-temperature envi- ronments, enabling them to withstand temperatures up to 1,000 C. This morph loses 1 point of COO for every 5 minutes it spends at temperatures lower than 250 C, and 1 point of COO for every minute that it spends below 150 C.
     When its COO equals zero the morph becomes completely immobile. This same penalty is applied to all COO-based skill rolls. The morph's cyberbrain and mesh access still work in these circumstances, but the morph cannot physically move under its own power. Even if placed back in higher temperatures, if it was previously reduced to total immobility, the morph halves its COO and SOM (round down) until it has been serviced.

    This morph lacks hands or other limbs with a fine manipulation capability. It is a common trait with quadrupeds (as well as certain smart animals). A morph with this trait may not be able to manipulate objects at all or may only be able to do so with a very limited capacity. Some morphs can hold small-sized or smaller tools, weapons, and other objects between their paws or in their mouths, for example, but unless these items have been specifically designed to operate with this morphology, the character will suffer a âˆ’30 modifier to use or may not be able to use them at all (gamemaster discretion). Objects that don't require physical manipu- lation, such as tools controlled by wireless commands, may be used normally. Some morphs with this trait-- particularly quadrupeds--may be unable to hold an object between their paws and move at the same time or may require a SOM x 3 Test to retain their balance while standing upright to hold something.

    The morph is significantly larger than a normal transhuman, which has its advantages and disadvantages. The character counts as a large target in combat, granting all enemies a +10 bonus on attack rolls against the character. Their mass works against them; double the damage from falling or collisions after armor is applied. The character gains the reach advantage (p. 204, EP) against standard-size targets (double this against small targets) and can also wield two-handed weapons in one hand without penalty.
    
     At the gamemaster's discretion, the character may suffer a âˆ’20 modifier when handling small items, assuming they come equipped with no fine manipu- lators. Naturally, they may also have difficulty with armor, clothing, and other gear manufactured for smaller morphs, as well as the cramped confines of many habitats. This trait applies to morphs that are inherently large. To apply it to existing morphs with a smaller baseline, use the Enlarged Size trait (p. 83,TH).

Treat the character as suffering the effects of high gravity (p. 199, EP) for every full 0.2 g over 0.15. For example, while the character would operate fine on Luna or Titan, on Mars or Mercury (both 0.38 g) the character would be treated as if suffering the effects of 1 wound. On Venus (0.9 g), the character would be treated as if suffering the effects of 3 wounds. For each of these high gravity increments, also reduce the character's Walking Rate by 1 and their Running Rate by 4. While even low-gravity- adapted bodies can sustain the stress of high gravity (over 1 g) for temporary periods, the gamemaster may rule that long-term exposure to higher gravity may result in the accumulation of actual wounds, not just wound effects.

    This particular morph has an anomalous neural structure. As a result, sometimes not all aspects of an ego are properly erased after it has been uploaded and the mind is customarily wiped. This morph has memories from a previous ego that continue to resurface. Once per week, the ego sleeved in the morph must make a MOX x 10 Test. If it fails, certain memories will manifest in the current occupant's mind. This memories are likely to be from emotionally charged or otherwise memorable events in a previous ego's life. The first time the latent memories activate, the ego suffers (1d10 Ã· 2) SV. Additional incidents of memory recall may or may not inflict stress, depending on the memory in question (traumatic ones certainly will), how drastically the memories conflict with the character's personality, and whether or not the character is aware of the source of these memories. The character naturally integrates these memories in with their own, making them a long-term or possibly permanent change that can only be removed with psychotherapy. These memories may of course be useful for plot purposes, as they may include sensitive data, secrets hidden from the public, or information the previous ego does not want spread.

    The morph is a hypercorp model that requires periodic GSP (Genetic Service Pack) therapy. For every three months of game time, the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph on GSP "upgrades." If they fail to do so, the morph's SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve. This trait is only available to biomorphs (including uplifts and pods).

     This morph was built to non-standard specifications, so that normal tools and software do not properly work on this morph. This is a conscious design decision by the manufacturer of the morph and is often used as a means of control. By limiting access to repair and modifications, the morph is dependent on the manufacturer. Highly skilled technicians can work around these barriers, but it impedes work. Standard repair and diagnostic tools like repair spray and fixer nanoswarms do not work on this morph, except for manufacturer-approved brands. Characters with Hardware: Robotics can repair or modify the morph but at a âˆ’20 modifier.

    The morph is significantly smaller than a normal transhuman, roughly child-sized. The character counts as a small target in combat; apply a âˆ’10 modifier to attacks against the character. Standard-size opponents have a reach advantage against the character and large and very large opponents will have double this advantage. The character may also, at the gamemaster's discretion, suffer a âˆ’20 modifier when handling medium-sized gear or two-handed weapons that have not been modified for their size. They may also have difficulty with armor, gear, and so on manufactured for larger morphs. Small morphs have an aptitude maximum for SOM of 25.

    The ego or morph has an overwhelming primal drive that is not properly filtered by the brain, such as the urge for hunting, hiding food, mating, marking territory, driving off competitors (or, for the rare synthmorph, cleaning, serving, or shutting down when not in use), and so on. When presented with triggering stimuli, the character must pass a WIL x 3 Test to resist acting out the compulsion immediately. While resisting the compulsion, the character suffers a âˆ’10 to all actions. Uncontrollable drives are poorly received in most circles. This trait is most common among uplifts.

    The morph is engineered to stand out in a society with sophisticated cloning and fabrication technology. The exact nature of the unique look varies based on the morph.

Others are secured by reputation alone--the look of an infamous triad crime boss would never be copied for fear of retribution. Whatever the reason, no one will mistake this morph for someone else. Any attempt to impersonate a morph with this trait suffers a âˆ’30 penalty.</b> Characters with this trait tend to cause extremely positive or negative reactions in social situations. <b>Characters with this trait may gain a positive modifier of up to +30 in certain Social Skill Tests or suffer up to a âˆ’30 penalty on Social Skill Tests, depending on the circumstance.
