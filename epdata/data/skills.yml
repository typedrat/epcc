- name: Animal Handling
  description: |
    Skilled animal handlers are able to train and control a wide variety of natural and transgenic animals, including partial uplifts. Though many animal species went extinct during the Fall, a few "ark" and zoo habitats keep some species alive, and many others can be resurrected from genetic samples. Exotic animals are considered a sign of prestige among the hypercorp elites, and guard animals are occasionally used to protect high-security installations. Likewise, many habitats and settlements employ small armies of partially uplifted, genetically modified, and behavior-controlled creatures for sanitation or other purposes. Many new and strange breeds of animal are created daily to serve a variety of roles.

    Animal Handling is used whenever you are trying to manipulate an animal, whether your intent is to calm it down, keep it from attacking, intimidate it, acquire its trust, or goad it into attacking. Your Margin of Success determines how effective you are at convincing the creature. At the gamemaster's discretion, modifiers may be applied to the test. Likewise, winning an animal over may sometimes take time, and so could be handled as a Task Action with a timeframe of five minutes or more.

    Specializations: Per animal species (dogs, horses, smart rats, etc.)

- name: Demolitions
  description: |
    Demolitions covers the use of controlled explosives.

    Use it when making, placing, and disarming explosives and explosive devices.

    Specializations: Commercial Explosives, Disarming, Improvised ExplosivesThe most common use of the Demolitions skill is the placement, disarming, or manufacture of explosive devices, such as superthermite charges or grenades.<h3>Placing Explosives</h3>A skilled demolitionist can place charges in a manner that will boost their effect. They can identify structural vulnerabilities and weak points and focus a blast in these areas. They can determine how to blast open a safe without destroying the contents. They can focus the force of an explosion in a particular direction, increasing the directed force while minimizing splash effects.Each of these scenarios calls for a successful Demolitions Test. The exact result is determined by the gamemaster according to the specific scenario. For example, using the examples above, targeting a weak point could double the damage inflicted on that structure. Shaping the charge to direct the force can triple the damage in that direction, as noted in the superthermite description. An Excellent Success is likely to increase an explosive's damage by +5, whereas a critical success would allow the blast to ignore armor.<h3>Disarming</h3>Disarming an explosive device is handled as an Opposed Test between the Demolitions skills of the disarmer and the character who set the bomb.<h3>Making Explosives</h3>A character trained in Demolitions can make explosives from raw materials. These materials can be gathered the traditional way or they can be manufactured using a nanofabricator. Even nanofabbers with restricted settings to prevent explosives creation can be used, as explosives can be constructed from all manner of mundane chemicals and materials. The timeframe for making explosives is 1 hour per 1d10 points of damage the explosive will inflict. If a critical failure is rolled, the demolitionist may accidentally blow himself up, or the charge may be extremely weaker or more potent than expected (whichever is more likely to be disastrous).

    Use Swimming whenever you need to move and survive in water or another liquid environment. Swimming in a non-threatening environment can be handled as a Simple Success Test. Swimming over a long distance could be handled as a Task Action. Diving off a cliff into a lake, preventing yourself from being swept away in a raging river current, or making sure you've set a proper gas mix for a deep-sea dive, among other things, requires a Success Test.
