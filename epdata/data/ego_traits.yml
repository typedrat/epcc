    The character is part of or has a relationship with some influential group that they can occasionally call on for support. For example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the character's relationship is with this group, and why the character can call on them for aid. Gamemaster's should take care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more than once per game session. The character's ties to this group are also a two-way street--they will be expected to perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for scenarios).

    Found almost exclusively in AGIs, uplifts, and the subjects of highly experimental pyschosurgical procedures, your mental patterns are dramatically outside the norm of transhumanity. The uniqueness of their mental map makes psychosurgery, routine backup, and resleeving difficult and risky. Any attempts to perform psychosurgery on the character suffer a -10 penalty and automatically cause 1 SV in addition to any other results and regardless of the success or failure of a procedure. Also, backing up and resleeving are not automatic (pp. 268-271, EP) and require active management of the process. Any technician operating the ego bridge during such procedures must succeed on a Psychosurgery Test or the backup/sleeving attempt will fail.

    In the past, the character suffered a serious complication during an attempt to merge a fork that caused irreparable damage to their ego map, leaving them with a weaker grip on their memories and own identity. For some reason--perhaps due to irreproducible memories or information that would otherwise be lost, moral conviction, or the lack of any prior backup states to re-instance--the decision was made to carry on with a damaged mind. Now, high-stress situations can cause periods of dissociation, amnesia, and body alienation. Whenever the character takes stress damage, they must succeed on an INT x 3 Test or immediately enter a dissociative state where they feel disconnected from their body, lose some awareness of the events around them, and/ or forget certain information, memories, or skills. In this state they suffer a -10 penalty on all tests. The dissociative state persists for one minute or for the duration of a derangement if one is acquired due to trauma.

    Although possessed of a rough self-awareness and the trappings of sapience, your mental development is flawed. Despite the best efforts of your creators and teachers, you cannot ever fully overcome your mental limita- tions and serious social awkwardness. Even psychosurgery is unlikely to fix you. You have an aptitude maximum of 10 for both COG or SAV. You have difficulty keeping up with others in complex social situations and are likely highly reliant on your muse to organize your life and coach you through your daily affairs. Whoever does interact with you likely treats you with either contempt or pity, as your difficulties are apparent to anyone who has more than the briefest exchanges with you.

    The character is in debt to a loan shark or powerful organization that demands regular payments. The debt may be the result of a legitimate loan or the character may be a victim of extortion. Either way, the character is expected to pay, with an interest rate that is far above standard (and possibly illegal), and the creditor organization will not take no for an answer.
    
    Each week the character is expected to make a payment on the debt equal to the weekly interest. Failure to do so will cause the creditor organization to retaliate, which can take any number of forms. Hypercorp creditors may lower the character's rep by publicly declaring them a deadbeat while criminal syndicates may send ego hunters to extract full payment. Many organizations employ debt collectors that know how to get money from reluctant debtors one way or the other. If the character completely reneges on this debt, they gain the Black Mark (Level 2) and Enemy traits.
    
    Characters may be given the option of working off their weekly interest payment--or even their entire debt--by performing a job or other favor for the creditor organization. Generally, this will be a high risk mission for which the organization does not want to use its own personnel, such as retrieval of data from an exsurgent-infested abandoned habitat or assassinating the head of a Martian crime syndicate. The higher the debt is, the more dangerous or difficult the mission will be.

    This trait is only available to uplifts and is most common among neo-hominids.
    
    The character retains pre-sapient neurological urges to gain social status via dominance. The character must make a WIL x 2 Test to use Persuasion skill in any situation where they can safely deploy Intimidation skill instead. Additionally, they must make a WIL x 3 Test to avoid responding to acts of intimidation with threat displays or violence, though such violence need not be lethal (note that they will still back down if someone successfully uses Intimidation skill on them). Since the evolutionary purpose of dominance structures is to minimize conflict, domineering uplifts prefer to surround themselves with submissives and will avoid entering situations where they know their dominance might be challenged. Such domineering characters often suffer poor reputations in modern transhuman reputation networks. They may not start with a rep score higher than 40 in any rep network other than Guanxi.

    This trait is only available to uplifts. 
    
    This uplift's particular brain structure has difficulty processing language. Tes some of their ability to speak, read, and comprehend things spoken by others when they suffer from stress. Each time the uplift suffers a trauma, they must make a Language Test at -10 to speak (both verbal and via mesh inserts) or comprehend (reading or listening) anything above the most basic words and information. This test only needs to be made once for each language, but for each additional trauma suffered, the test must be made again, with an additional cumulative -10 modifier. If the uplift loses their language abilities, they will recover them when that particular trauma is healed. In the meantime, they can only convey and understand basic, one-word, one-syllable concepts, such as ""eat"" or ""run.""

    Many characters retain close relationships with family, friends, and lovers. Sometimes, however, the interpersonal connection in these relationships becomes so intense as to be a detriment. The character is emotionally dependent on their relationship with a particular NPC to the point that being separated from the NPC is taxing. Each week the character goes without meaningful communication with the NPC, they suffer 1 point of stress. If cut off for more than two weeks, they also suffer a -10 modifier to all Task Actions until they are able to reconnect, as they are too distracted to focus. The character also suffers double the stress from witnessing the NPC being hurt or killed. Basic operational security dictates that the character cannot tell the NPC anything about Firewall nor can they communicate with the NPC during a Firewall mission. Characters breaking these rules put the lives of their friends and family at risk. Gamemasters should have enemies of Firewall use friends and family against characters who break these rules.

    When it comes to brute-force hacking, this character has an intuitive sense for finding and deploying the right exploit tool for the job. Reduce the base timeframe for brute-force hacking (p. 257, EP) by 20% per level. Since brute-forcing a system is normally a Task Action with a 20 Action Turn timeframe, at Level 1 this timeframe is reduced to 16 Action Turns and at Level 2 it is reduced to 12 Action Turns. As usual, every 10 points of MoS on the Infosec Test may reduce this another 10%; these and other reductions (such as from Speed and extra actions; TH p. 96) are added together before they are applied to the timeframe.

    The character has an influential person in their life who can be relied on for occasional support. This could be a wealthy hyperelite family member, a high-ranking triad boss, or an anarchist networker with an unbeatable reputation. When called upon, this patron can pull strings on the character's behalf, supply resources, introduce them to people they need to know, and bail them out of trouble. The player and gamemaster should work together to define exactly who this NPC is and what their relationship with the player character is. Specifically, the question of why this patron is supporting the character should be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies? the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters should be careful that this trait does not get abused. The patron should be an occasional help (probably no more than once per game session at most) but is not always at the character's beck-and-call. If the character asks for too much, too often, they should find the patron's support drying up. Additionally, the character may need to take action to maintain the relationship, such as undertaking a mission on the patron's behalf. In fact, the character may only have their patronage because they are on-call or of use to the NPC in some way.

    An unfortunate aspect of the character background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. They may be sleeved in a morph viewed with repugnance, be a survivor of the infamous Lost generation, or may be an AGI in a post-Fall society plagued by fear of artificial intelligence.
    
    In social situations where the character nature is known to someone who view that nature with distaste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a -10 to -30 modifier (gamemaster's discretion) to social skill tests.

    This trait is only available to neo-octopi uplifts.
    
    Like its pre-sapient kin, this uplift prefers solitude and has not been fully socialized. As a result, they can only tolerate 2 hours of direct interaction (physical or virtual) with others before they need a break and some alone time (at least 2 hours). If forced into a situation where they must interact or exist in close proximity to others for more than 2 hours, they suffer a cumulative -10 modifier to all Social Skill Tests per 2-hour period, up to a maximum of -30. After 6 hours, they must a WIL x 3 Test to keep their composure and not react towards those around them with aggression, hostility, or even violence.
    
    This trait is usually taken in conjunction with the Hardening (Isolation) trait.

    The character holds a tenured professorship at a university such as Titan Autonomous University or the University of Mars. This position gives them privileged access to the university's resources, funds, and grad assistants. The character receives a +20 bonus on Networking Tests involving the university and its staff. Additionally, favors such as goods, services, and information acquired via those university network connections are one favor level lower. These bonuses do not extend outside the university's influence. The tenured character will, of course, be expected to occasionally produce research results or other findings or pieces of work to validate their exploitation of university resources.

    This character has a higher threshold for handling traumatic experiences and is better at ignoring the effects of stress on their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them to ignore the -10 modifier from 1 trauma. Level 2 allows them to ignore the -10 modifiers from 2 traumas. Initiative modifiers still apply. In both cases, the character is also not immediately inflicted with any derangements as a result of these traumas. Any additional traumas affect the character as normal; postponed derange- ments don't count for the purpose of raising derangement effects, but they do count towards determining when a disorder is applied. Blocking out traumatically stressful experiences is a temporary measure, however, as the experience still lingers and festers in the dark recesses of the character's mind. A short period of time later (1d10√∑2 hours, round down), the character's facade of mental fortitude will crack and the -10 trauma modifier(s) and derangement(s) will kick in at one level higher. A character who ignored a trauma that would have inflicted a minor derangement, for example, will a few hours later be struck by a moderate derangement.

    Sometime in the past, this character got their 5 minutes of mesh fame in a funny viral meme that swept the solar system. To this day, strangers who access the character's social profile are likely to connect them to that meme. Though tedious for the character, there is a positive side effect, as these strangers remember the meme fondly and are more likely to help the character out. Once per game session, the gamemaster may decide that a stranger with whom the character is interacting and who has access to the character\s online public profile recognizes the char- acter. The character receives a one-time +20 bonus to any social skill or Networking Test with that stranger.
